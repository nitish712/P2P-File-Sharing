P2P-File-Sharing
================

A python program which creates an Anonymous P2P Network and allows the clients for sharing files anonymously. Although it was successful in sending files even in a wireless network, it hasn't been tested for large files, and may not be efficient. However, anonymity was guarenteed in most of the scenarios.
Just run the 'main.py' and wait until there are atleast 3 clients in the network who are running the same code. Then one can either send or receive files by issuing search queries into the network.
